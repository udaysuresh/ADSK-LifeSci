# Glimmer3 (Gene Locator and Interpolated Markov ModelER)

(primitive Markov Models – not HMM)

Trying to use Glimmer3 to lookup orfs if given a testing sequence (generally needs to be long and close to human / rice / arabidopsis Thaliana for Markov Models to grip)

Identifies the long, open reading frames (ORFs) in a DNA sequence file – provides the start codon, stop codon, alignment, direction, and entropy match between similar ORFs.
