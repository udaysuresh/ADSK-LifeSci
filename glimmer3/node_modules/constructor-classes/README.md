Constructor's models and schemas can be consumed in a separate npm package.

This directory produces that package, but slurping them up from the project and bundling them up.

Generally, build with `npm run build-classes` and deploy with `npm run deploy-classes`

If you have an issue pushing changes, try something like:

```
git remote add constructor-classes https://github.com/autodesk-lifesciences/constructor-classes.git
git push constructor-classes `git subtree split --prefix constructor-classes master`:master --force
```
